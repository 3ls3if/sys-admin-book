<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (119).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### What is Hybrid Azure AD Join? <a href="#what-is-hybrid-azure-a-d-join" id="what-is-hybrid-azure-a-d-join"></a>

**Hybrid Azure AD Join** connects your on-premises Active Directory infrastructure with Azure AD, making devices visible in both environments. This lets users seamlessly access resources and services across both on-premises and cloud environments

### Benefits of Hybrid Azure AD Join <a href="#benefits-of-hybrid-azure-a-d-join" id="benefits-of-hybrid-azure-a-d-join"></a>

Using Hybrid Azure AD Join to integrate on-premises and cloud environments offers several key advantages:

#### Streamlined user experience <a href="#streamlined-user-experience" id="streamlined-user-experience"></a>

Joining on-premises and cloud services using Azure AD Hybrid Join provides users with a seamless and consistent experience across all resources. Users can access both on-premises and cloud-based applications using [single sign-on (SSO)](https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/saml-vs-sso-whats-the-difference/) with the same set of credentials, eliminating the need for multiple logins and reducing user frustration. &#x20;

#### Centralized user management <a href="#centralized-user-management" id="centralized-user-management"></a>

Administrators can manage user accounts for the integrated services from a single location. They can create, update, and delete user accounts in the on-premises Active Directory and the changes will automatically synchronize with Microsoft Azure Active Directory, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of errors.

#### Enhanced security <a href="#enhanced-security" id="enhanced-security"></a>

Your organization can enforce stronger security measures within an integrated environment. Hybrid Azure AD Join enables administrators to [implement conditional access policies](https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/configure-conditional-access-policies-ad/) that control user access based on factors such as device compliance and location, helping to [protect sensitive data](https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/data-protection-plan-guide-steps-for-creation/) and resources from unauthorized access.

### How Hybrid Azure AD Join works <a href="#how-hybrid-azure-a-d-join-works" id="how-hybrid-azure-a-d-join-works"></a>

Hybrid Azure AD Join requires these services to operate:&#x20;

#### Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Azure AD <a href="#active-directory-domain-services-a-d-ds-and-azure-ad" id="active-directory-domain-services-a-d-ds-and-azure-ad"></a>

[Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview), Microsoft’s on-premises directory service, stores and manages user accounts, computer accounts and other directory objects. Azure AD is a cloud-based identity and access management service that provides authentication and authorization services for cloud-based resources.

#### Azure AD Connect <a href="#azure-a-d-connect" id="azure-a-d-connect"></a>

[Azure AD Connect](https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/azure-ad-connect-what-it-is-and-how-to-configure-it/) facilitates user account synchronization between on-premises AD DS and Azure AD. It establishes a connection between the two services, ensuring that changes made in one environment are reflected in the other.

#### Hybrid Azure AD Join process <a href="#hybrid-azure-a-d-join-process" id="hybrid-azure-a-d-join-process"></a>

The Azure AD Hybrid Join process involves the following steps:

1. Install and configure Azure AD Connect on a server in the on-premises environment. This server acts as a bridge between AD DS and Azure AD.
2. Synchronize user accounts from the on-premises AD DS to Azure AD to ensure accounts and their attributes are consistent across both environments.
3. Register the device that is part of the on-premises network with Azure AD. This establishes a trust relationship between the device and Azure AD.
4. Complete the Hybrid Azure AD Join process. After registering the device, it can join both the on-premises AD DS domain and Azure AD simultaneously.&#x20;

### Requirements for setting up Hybrid Azure AD Join <a href="#requirements-for-setting-up-hybrid-azure-a-d-join" id="requirements-for-setting-up-hybrid-azure-a-d-join"></a>
