In case there are certain files that you may have received during or after the process, you have the option to export only those items.

Mark the Delta Migration option, which will re-scan the mailbox again for any newly arrived data. If there is any new file, the tool will export only those files. Moreover, this tool also assists you in [moving a domain between Office 365 Tenants](https://www.systoolsgroup.com/updates/how-to-move-domain-between-office-365-tenants-migration-guide/).
