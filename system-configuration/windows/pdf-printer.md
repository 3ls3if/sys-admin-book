# PDF Printer

## Introduction

A **PDF printer** is a virtual printer that allows you to "print" documents as PDF files instead of sending them to a physical printer. When you select a PDF printer from the list of available printers on your device, it converts the document into a PDF format and saves it on your computer or chosen location. This is useful for preserving the layout, fonts, and formatting of documents across different devices.

#### **How It Works:**

1. **Create or open a document** (e.g., Word, Excel, webpage, etc.).
2. **Select "Print"** as if you were printing a physical copy.
3. **Choose the PDF printer** (e.g., "Microsoft Print to PDF" or third-party software like "Adobe PDF").
4. **Click "Print"** â€” Instead of paper, it asks for a save location.
5. **Save the file** as a PDF.

#### **Common Use Cases:**

* Sharing documents where formatting consistency is crucial.
* Archiving files in a non-editable format.
* Converting web pages, forms, or emails to PDF.

#### **Popular PDF Printers:**

* **Microsoft Print to PDF** (Built-in on Windows)
