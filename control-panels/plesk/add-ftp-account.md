## How to add FTP account in plesk

**Introduction**&#x20;

The abbreviation “[FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol)” stands for “File Transfer Protocol,” which is the name given to a set of guidelines that determine how files are transferred between computer systems using the internet. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used by businesses to transfer files between computers, and websites use FTP to upload and download files from the servers that host their websites.

If you and another person are working on your website together or if you host subdomains for other users, you may want to create separate FTP accounts for each of those parties.
