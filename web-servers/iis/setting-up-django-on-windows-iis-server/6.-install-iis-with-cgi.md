# 6. Install IIS with CGI

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is IIS?**

Internet Information Services (IIS) is an extensible web server created by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family to serve HTML pages or files. That is, IIS would accept request from a remote clients computers and respond with the requested data. IIS is to Windows, what Apache is to Linux/MacOS._Even if you already have IIS installed, you may need to go through these steps to install the CGI feature if it wasn’t installed as part of the original IIS installation._
