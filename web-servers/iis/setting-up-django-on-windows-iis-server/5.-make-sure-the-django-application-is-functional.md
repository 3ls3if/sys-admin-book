# 5. Make sure the Django Application is functional

Start the Django Development Server:

```
$ python manage.py runserver
```

This should start a functional Django Application on `localhost` — if you’ve kept the defaults, you can see your Django site by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

We aren’t done yet though. This is just the Development server running locally. We need to make the install ready for production…
