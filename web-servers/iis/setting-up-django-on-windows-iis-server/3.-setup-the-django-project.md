# 3. Setup the Django Project

Install Django and other project dependencies:

1.  Place your Django code directory inside the `django_iis_demo_env` directory.

    cd into your Django code directory.
2.  Install the project dependencies:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Install wfastcgi

    pip install wfastcgi



wfastcgi is a WSGI similar in purpose to Gunicorn or uwsgi. `wfastcgi` is maintained by Microsoft and you would be better of using this than trying to compile other linux based WSGI servers on windows. If your Django App is to be used on Windows only, you can consider putting `wfastcgi` in the requirements.txt file.
