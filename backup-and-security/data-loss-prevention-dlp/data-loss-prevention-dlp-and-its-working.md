# Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and It's Working

In today's world Organisations handle large volumes of data, which has resulted in increased data breaches. To Overcome this we require strong solutions for safeguarding sensitive information. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems are important for data security because they monitor, identify, and prohibit unwanted access, ensuring that sensitive information remains inside the organization's secured Storage. It is a practice that guarantees that the sensitive data of the organization is shared with its authorized users. It also ensures that it does not fall into the hands of unauthorized people.

### **Purpose of DLP**

**DLP** is highly crucial for a company to keep its data protected; here are the reasons why. These are listed below as follows.

* It helps in the protection of sensitive personal data as well as legal compliance. The vast majority of organizations have very sensitive databases, and everything may go wrong if they get into the wrong hands. Doing the right thing is essential for keeping safe.
* You must also protect your intellectual property and maintain your corporate secrets. It should not fall into the hands of a competitor, and the goal of **DLP** is to protect data from being accidentally exposed online.
* By locking down your data, you may get visibility to all of your data. You must choose where your data is stored and how to transfer it around. You will be able to examine your data infrastructure with the help of [**DLP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/data-loss-prevention-dlp-and-its-working/).

### **DLP function**

When you process material, you get a variety of content analysis approaches, which we'll go through below as follows.

1. **Regular expressions or rule-based expressions:** This is one of the most effective DLP techniques, and it entails two particular rules: a 16-digit credit card number and a 9-digit US social security number. This method is rapid since the rules were set up quickly. Every procedure began with good rates that had not been validated.\
   &#x20;
2. **Statistical Analysis:** Another statistical approach, such as [Bayesian analysis](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-science/power-of-bayesian-statistics-probability/), can be used to perform the trigger violation and secure the material. You'll need the largest amount of data you can handle in order to scan it.\
   &#x20;
3. **Partial document matching:** It appears that the partial match with the particular files is the case. It indicates it contains several versions, each of which was filled out by a separate person.\
   &#x20;
4. **Pre-built categories:** A prebuilt category is a sensitive data rule and vocabulary that acts as a safeguard for your business.\
   &#x20;
5. **Database fingerprinting:** Exact Data Matching is a term that refers to the process of finding an exact match in a database. The connection is made to the live database, which has an impact on performance. This is the option to use if you need structured data from the database.\
   &#x20;
6. **Exact File Matching:** Each file's content cannot be examined, therefore each file's fingerprints will differ somewhat. It also has a low rate of false positives in cases where the technique isn't the same or comparable to others.\
   &#x20;
7. **Conceptual or Lexicon:** In this, you can apply a combination of dictionaries, and these policies can alert you to the unstructured idea that defines simple classification. When it comes to concept, the owner needs to customize everything.

### DLP's Investigation Component

An essential part of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is its ability to not only prevent data breaches but also to investigate incidents when they occur. DLPâ€™s investigation component includes tools that monitor and track data activities, enabling security teams to conduct detailed audits and identify the source of data leaks. These tools provide insights into suspicious data transfers, helping organizations respond to and mitigate breaches quickly. They also assist in creating reports for compliance and improving security policies based on investigative findings.

### **Data Loss Prevention Services -DLP's Applications**

In most cases, data loss prevention addresses the three primary goals that are similar in all businesses. Here they are as follows.

* **Protection of personal data:** Every business gathers and retains personally identifiable information, protected health information, credit card information, and so on. To secure your important customers' data, you can employ [HIPAA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/top-cybersecurity-frameworks/) and [GDPR](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethical-hacking/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-considerations/). DLP's major task is to classify, identify, and tag sensitive data in order to properly monitor everything. Reporting capabilities are always able to offer the level of detail required.\
  &#x20;
* **Visibility of data:** Your company wants to increase its visibility in data migration. A strong DLP system will help in data tracking throughout the network, endpoints, and cloud. You'll also be able to see how individual users interact with data throughout the company.\
  &#x20;
* **IP Protection:** You will have the perfect secret to place for your organization's health if your company has intellectual property. DLP acts as a digital guardian, classifying intellectual property using context-based categorization for both structured and unstructured forms. You must be able to regulate the policies that safeguard your data against undesired ex-filtration.

### **Prevent Data Loss Through Adoption**

1. **Growth of the CISO role :** Many organizations employ Chief Information Security Officers who must report to the CEO, who must be aware of the game plan in order to prevent data breaches. DLP always provides tangible business benefits, such as the reporting capabilities required to deliver regular updates to the CEO.\
   &#x20;
2. **More places to keep your data safe :** If you use the cloud more frequently, you will complicate the supply chain network and lose control over other services. You'll be able to see all the occasions where sensitive data will be kept safe.\
   &#x20;
3. **Identification of data :** It's difficult to identify whether data needs to be secured, and it's more vulnerable when everything is done manually and according to the regulations. They have automated approaches for machine learning.\
   &#x20;
4. **Detecting data leaks- DLP :** It operates in the same way as other security systems, such as[ IDS, IPS, SIEM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethical-hacking/intrusion-detection-system-ids/), and other data transfers that are suspicious or unusual. These systems can send a notification to security personnel, preventing data leakage.\
   &#x20;
5. **Changing Compliance Requirements :** GDP's laws and regulations are continuously changing, and the organization must adapt. DPL additionally tightens the data in order to meet the data protection requirements. This solution also enables the company to be adaptable and alter worldwide regulations.\
   &#x20;
6. **The organization has stolen data :** Typically, when businesses steal data, they obtain it from the [Dark Web](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/difference-between-deep-web-and-dark-web/), where individuals acquire it for their own gain. Only a small percentage of data is sold for thousands of dollars.\
   &#x20;
7. **Data used for security :** Few DLP systems keep track of flagged and unauthorized behavior so that users can interact with data on purpose.\
   &#x20;
8. **Endpoints of security :** Endpoint-based agents may basically transport data between users, external parties, and groups. This system can prevent communication attempts so that the provider can make use of user input.\
   &#x20;
9. **Security data in motion :** You'll need to set up a network that can analyze traffic and discover critical information.\
   &#x20;
10. **Resting security data :** This user will have access controls, including the ability to comply with data encryption and retention policies. It can also keep stored organizational data secure.

### Conclusion

Data loss prevention (DLP) is a technique that is used for protecting sensitive information and maintaining confidentiality. Organizations effectively monitor and respond to data breaches by deploying a number of DLP techniques and investigation tools. Efficient DLP approach protects sensitive data, but it also improves overall security to defense against evolving threats.
