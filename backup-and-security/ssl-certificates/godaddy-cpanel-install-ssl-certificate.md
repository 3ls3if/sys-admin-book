After your [certificate request](https://www.godaddy.com/en-in/help/generate-a-csr-certificate-signing-request-for-my-cpanel-hosting-32044) is approved, you can [download your certificate](https://www.godaddy.com/en-in/help/download-my-ssl-certificate-files-4754) from the SSL manager and install it on your Web Hosting (cPanel) plan.



### Steps

1. If you haven't done it already, [download your certificate](https://www.godaddy.com/en-in/help/download-my-ssl-certificate-files-4754) from the SSL manager and save the `.crt` file somewhere that's easy to find.
2. Go to your GoDaddy [product page](https://account.godaddy.com/products/).

4. Select **cPanel Admin**.
5. In the **Security** section, select **SSL/TLS**.
6. Under **Certificates (CRT)**, select **Generate, view, upload, or delete SSL certificates**.
7. In the **Upload a New Certificate** section, select **Choose File** and navigate to the `.crt` file you downloaded in step 1. Select the file and then select **Open**.
8. If you want to, type a description of the certificate in the **Description** text box.
9. Select **Upload Certificate**.
10. When you get confirmation that the certificate has been saved, select **Go Back**.
11. At the bottom of the **SSL Certificates** page, select **Return to SSL Manager**.
12. Under **Install and Manage SSL for your site (HTTPS)**, select **Manage SSL Sites**.
13. In the **Install an SSL Website** section, select **Browse Certificates**.
14. Select the certificate that you want to activate and select **Use Certificate**. This will auto-fill the fields for the certificate.
15. At the bottom of the page, select **Install Certificate**.
16. On the **Successfully Installed** pop up, select **OK**.
