## Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

The deployment tool you use influences how you onboard endpoints to the service. Refer to your selected [deployment method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/deployment-strategy#step-2-select-your-deployment-method).

If you're onboarding devices in the Microsoft Defender portal, follow these steps:

1. Make sure to review the [Minimum requirements for Defender for Endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/minimum-requirements).
2.  In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/), go to **Settings** > **Endpoints**, and then, under **Device management**, select **Onboarding**.
