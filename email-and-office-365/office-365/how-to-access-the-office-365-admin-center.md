# How to Access the Office 365 Admin Center

## Introduction

Almost all cloud services that allow you to manage multiple users have a special administration interface. Microsoft Office 365 is categorized as software as a service (SaaS) and provides its own Microsoft Office 365 admin center. This administration center can be used to manage user accounts and mailboxes, configure the Office 365 cloud environment, monitor statistics, and so on.

## **How to Access the Office 365 Admin Center?**

The Microsoft Office 365 admin center can be accessed in a web interface by using a web browser. Following the Microsoft’s official announcement, Office 365 was renamed to Microsoft 365, meaning that the new Office 365 admin center can be referred to as Microsoft 365 admin center. Integration with other Microsoft services is now easier when using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Open your web browser and go to:

[https://login.microsoftonline.com](https://login.microsoftonline.com/)

Enter your administrator account name, for example, _admin@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com_ and click **Next**.

Enter the password for your admin account and click **Sign in**.

[![Entering the passwrd of the Office 365 admin account](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Entering-the-password-of-the-Office-365-admin-account.webp)](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Entering-the-password-of-the-Office-365-admin-account.webp)

If you have configured [Multi-factor authentication](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/office-365-app-password-and-multi-factor-authentication/) for Office 365 admin login, you must enter a confirmation code before you continue.

Once you log into the Office 365 web page, you see links to online applications, such as Word Online, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and so on, that are available for your subscription plan. When you are logged in as administrator, you can find the Admin icon on this page. Click the **Admin** icon to open the Microsoft Office 365 admin center. If you don’t see the Admin icon, you don’t have administrative permissions for Office 365 in your organization. By default, a person who creates a Microsoft account and buys Office 365 subscription for business gets administrative permissions and has the Office 365 admin account.

As an alternative, you can enter a direct link to Microsoft admin center in a web browser:

[https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)

**Enter Office 365 admin account name and password to sign in.**

Office 365 admin center is available only for organization accounts using business subscription plans. Accounts for organizations should be configured to use a domain for Office 365 services. The Office 365 admin center is not available for separate home users who use personal accounts and subscription plans.\

## **Interface Components**

Once you log into Microsoft 365 admin center (formerly known as Office 365 admin center), you can see three main panels and options in the center of the window.

The top panel is the horizontal panel that contains the five main elements of the graphical user interface (GUI). This panel is available for all Office 365 users. Use this panel to configure a user profile for an Office 365 account.

**1. Office 365 menu**. Click the 9-dot menu icon to open the Office 365 menu. You can switch to any Office 365 online application available for your subscription plan in this menu. The Admin icon is available only for users who have administrative permissions.

## **The Left Navigation Pane**

The left navigation pane is the most essential for the Microsoft Office 365 admin center because you can navigate to settings of your Office 365 domain and user accounts, manage groups, set permissions, and so on. This navigation pane looks like a menu with sections and subsections. Let’s review each section in details.

#### **Home**

Click this link to go back to the main page (landing page) of the Office 365 admin center.

In the center of the main page, you can see the following elements:

* **A search field** that allows you to search users, groups and other objects
* **+ Add card**. Add cards to your home page for quick access to frequently used pages, for example, a message center, Azure AD, reports, and so on. You can move, arrange and delete the cards to make the view more convenient.
* **Dark/Light mode**. Select the theme that you prefer. You can switch between a light mode and a dark mode.
* **What’s new**. Click this link to see what’s new in Microsoft admin center and Office 365. Microsoft updates Office 365 regularly and you will find all news here.
* **A switcher** between the new admin center and the old admin center.

### **Users** <a href="#anc_4" id="anc_4"></a>

The most common task for administrators is managing user accounts. In this section you can find four subsections to manage Office 365 user accounts of workers or students.

**Active users**. You can see a detailed list (table) of all users and their license status. You can also add a user, create user templates, add multiple users, and enable or disable multi-factor authentication. You can manage Office 365 users (add, edit, delete, export users), reset passwords, assign or remove user licenses, and use filters to select the needed users (which is useful if you have a large number of Office 365 users for your domain). You can sort active users by columns. For example, click _Username_ to sort users by a username.

**The columns are:**

Display name | Username | Licenses | Sign-in status | Sync status | Choose columns

Click **Choose columns** to select the columns to be displayed.

**Contacts** and **Guest users**. These options are used to create mail contacts of external users.

**Deleted users**. You can see a list of deleted users and restore the listed users if needed.



#### **Groups**

Use these options to manage Office 365 groups, security groups, [distribution lists](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/office-365-groups-vs-distribution-lists-comparison/) and shared mailboxes in your organization. When you manage Office 365 users, it is useful to sort them into groups and manage groups instead of managing each user separately.

![Managing groups in the Office 365 admin center](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Managing-groups-in-the-Office-365-admin-center-1024x520-1.webp)



#### **Roles**

The Microsoft 365 admin center allows the global Office 365 admin at your organization to assign different admin roles for other users (administrators). This approach may be useful if a number of users in your organization is large and you want to delegate some authority to other administrators who should be focused on Exchange management, license management or SharePoint management, for example.

You can find the full list of Office 365 admin roles on the Roles page. Read the description provided for each role to understand which role to assign to users.

#### **Resources**

The resources options allow you to create and manage resources, such as sites and conference rooms for conference purposes. You can see your SharePoint sites and site collections that are created in SharePoint for users’ collaboration and their external sharing status.

#### **Billing**

You can view your subscription status, purchase additional Microsoft cloud services, check billing and payments, configure payment methods, and so on. You can view and assign licenses and check how many licenses are available for your Office 365 subscription plan.

#### **Reports**

See a detailed report for a selected period of how users inside your company use Office 365 applications. You can monitor which applications are favorite among users and compare dynamics for the selected period (7, 30, 90 or 180 days). Reports can help you to identify which user of your company doesn’t use Office 365 services and may not need the license assigned to them and who uses a service a lot and is about to exceed quotas (for OneDrive, for example).

![Reports in Office 365 admin center](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reports-in-Office-365-admin-center-1024x520-1.webp)

#### **Health**

Open this section in the Office 365 admin center and check the health of your Office 365 services. If any interruptions happened or issues occurred, the alert icon is displayed near the service name and the number of incidents is displayed in the _Status_ column.

The _Admin centers_ section that is located in the bottom of the navigation pane groups all important configuration options for Office 365 products to allow the Office 365 company administrator to access all settings from the single interface of the Microsoft 365 admin center.
