# How to Create a Trial Account

To create a Microsoft 365 Business Standard trial account, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Trial Page:**
   * Visit the [Microsoft 365 Business Standard trial page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-business-standard-one-month-trial).
2. **Initiate the Trial:**
   * Click on the "Try free for one month" button.
3. **Set Up Your Account:**
   * If you don't have a Microsoft account, you'll need to create one.
   * Provide the required information, including your business email address and other relevant details.
4. **Provide Payment Information:**
   * Enter valid credit or debit card details. Note that while the trial is free for 30 days, your card will be automatically charged if you don't cancel before the trial period ends.
5. **Complete the Setup:**
   * Follow the on-screen instructions to finalize your account setup.
   * Once completed, you'll have access to Microsoft 365 Business Standard features for up to 25 users during the trial period.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Trial Limitations:** The trial allows up to 25 users. Each user can install Microsoft 365 apps on up to five PCs or Macs, five tablets, and five mobile devices.
