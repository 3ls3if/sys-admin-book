# Creating a Tenant

## Creating a free Microsoft 365 tenant for practice

Before we can start learning how to secure Microsoft 365 we will need a test tenant. A tenant where we can implement whatever you want and test things out before implementing them in production. A place where we can perform hands-on learning in a live environment without affecting production. Fortunately, we can set up a Microsoft 365 tenant for free to try out. You only need a free email address, such as gmail.com, outlook.com, or yahoo.com, and a phone number.

1\. Go to [Office 365 E5](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=iOIpmChCQh0\&offerid=817940.17\&type=3\&subid=0)    &#x20;

2\. Click [Free Trial](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=iOIpmChCQh0\&offerid=817940.17\&type=3\&subid=0)

4\. Click **Set up account**.

That's it. You now have a Microsoft 365 test tenant.
