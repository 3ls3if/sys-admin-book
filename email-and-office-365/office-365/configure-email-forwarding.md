### Set up forwarding in the Microsoft365 admin center <a href="#set-up-forwarding-in-the-microsoft365-admin-center" id="set-up-forwarding-in-the-microsoft365-admin-center"></a>

The recommended way to set up forwarding is from the Microsoft365 Admin Center. These are the steps you need to take to set up forwarding on your Office 365 account:

1\. Login to your Office 365 portal using your administrator account. From the menu on top, click **Admin > Exchange** to open Exchange Admin Center.

2\. From the menu on the left, click **Mail Flow** to create the forwarding rule.

3\. In the Rules tab, click the **‘+’ (plus)** button and select Create a new rule.

4\. Enter a name for this rule. We’ve given Rule Name as ‘Desk365 forwarding rule’ for this example.

### Set up forwarding in Outlook <a href="#set-up-forwarding-in-outlook" id="set-up-forwarding-in-outlook"></a>

These are the steps you need to follow to set up the forwarding rules correctly in Outlook

1\. Login to your Outlook account.

2\. At the top of the menu, choose **Settings.** A Setting dialog box appears on the screen.

3\. Navigate to Mail  > Forwarding.

4\. Toggle the **‘Enable Forwarding’** button and enter your support email address (support@yourdomain.desk365.io) for activating email forwarding for your account.

<figure><img src="https://help.desk365.io/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-forwarding-in-outlook-768x408.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

5\. Click **Save.**

Now that you’re done with forwarding, you can refer to our previous article in which we’ve explained [the steps needed to configure your custom support email in Desk365](https://help.desk365.io/en/articles/configuring-custom-support-emails-in-desk365/).

{% hint style="success" %}
1\. Avoid setting up forwarding using the ”Rules” option under settings. This results in emails being forwarded with a “FW:” prefix and the Contact not getting set up properly within your helpdesk.

2\. If you haven’t done already, we suggest enabling external email forwarding in Microsoft 365.

If a user has set up an automatic forwarding rule to an external address in their Microsoft 365 mailbox using Outlook, the message will not be forwarded when the rule is triggered. Instead, the user will receive a non-delivery report (NDR) indicating that the message was not delivered.

‘Remote Server returned ‘550 5.7.520 Access denied, Your organization does not allow external forwarding. Please contact your administrator for further assistance. AS(7555)’.

Even though a user sets up forwarding, a Global Admin has to first enable external forwarding. The outbound spam protection settings and automatic external forwarding can be enabled for any mailboxes by a Microsoft 365 administrator.
{% endhint %}

## External Forwarding

(i) Log in to the [Microsoft 365 Defender Portal](https://security.microsoft.com/) as a global admin.

(ii) Navigate to Policies & rules -> Threat policies.

(iii) Choose ‘Anti-spam policies’ option here.

(iv) Locate the ‘Anti-spam outbound policy’ in the list and select ‘Edit protection settings’.

<figure><img src="https://help.desk365.io/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/anti-spam-outbound-policy-edit-protection-settings.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

(v) Look for the ‘Forwarding rules’ section and select the ‘On-Forwarding is enabled’ option from the dropdown menu under Automatic forwarding rules to allow email forwarding.

<figure><img src="https://help.desk365.io/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/on-forwarding-is-enabled-option.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

(vi) Save your changes.

All your Microsoft 365 users can now configure automatic email forwarding to external mailboxes in Outlook.

3\. We also recommend you to set up DKIM records for your domain.

This article explains in detail about the importance of [setting up DKIM for your domain](https://help.desk365.io/en/articles/email-domain-verification-using-dkim/).
