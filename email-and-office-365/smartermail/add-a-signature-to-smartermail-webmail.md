\
1\. **Let's get started by logging in to your webmail account.** You can typically reach your webmail login with IQComputing at http://webmail.yourdomain.com/ or alternatively via http://mail002.iqcomputing.net/

Once you are logged in select the **Settings icon** ![settings icon](https://www.iqcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/articles/4123/smartermail16-settingsicon.jpg) from the top navigation bar and then go ahead and **select Signatures**.

Once you are happy with your custom signature give it a name and click "**Save**" at the lower right of the signature form.



4. You are now ready to add your signature to new outgoing messages. Let's go ahead and **select your new signature** from the signature drop down in a new message (doing this should add your saved custom signature to the new message window).
