# How to create a Post Office in MailEnable?

A post office is where you group domains and mailboxes for a customer. If you are a home user, or only expect to host your own domains, you will most likely only have one post office. If you host multiple domains for various people, you would create multiple post offices for customer accounts. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through creating a PostOffice in MailEnable console. It is assumed that MailEnable has already been installed on your Microsoft Windows server.\
\
