# Manage user accounts

## Manage user accounts

As an administrator for your organization's Google Workspace account, you can **delete** a user account, **suspend** a user account, **restore** a suspended or recently deleted user account, and **transfer** data ownership from one user account to another.

{% hint style="success" %}
When you delete a user, they lose access to all services and data associated with their account. When you suspend a user, they are temporarily blocked from using your organization’s Google Workspace services. After suspending a user, you can restore their account at any time.
{% endhint %}

## Notes

1. A user can also be automatically suspended from Gmail for exceeding sending limits. In this case, the user can still sign in to their Google Workspace account to access other services, such as Calendar and Drive. But when they try to access Gmail, an error suggests Google detected unusual activity on the account. Most users will regain access automatically within 24 hours, but in some cases, an administrator can reset the limits for the user and allow them to immediately regain access.
2. You can’t restore an account that was suspended for abuse or for breaching Google’s Terms of Service.
3. You can’t restore a user with an abusive account status. Administrators can contact Google Support for more information.
