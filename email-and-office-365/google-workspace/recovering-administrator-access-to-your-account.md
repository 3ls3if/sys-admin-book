# Recovering administrator access to your account

### Recover administrator access using support-assisted recovery

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you're unable to recover your administrator account through the automated self-recovery flow outlined above, you may be able to use supported-assisted recovery. You will need to provide evidence of ownership of the domain name and the data within the domain.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before you begin**

* You need to try automated recovery first, which may resolve your issue. Follow the steps above in [Recover administrator access using automated recovery](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33561?hl=en#automated).
* Before contacting Support, review the account information that will help Support verify you’re the account owner. Go to [Account recovery information for support](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10069996) and [Tips to complete account recovery steps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7299973).
{% endhint %}

**Use support-assisted recovery**

1.  After going through the automated-recovery flow, click **Contact support** on this screen:

    You're directed to the Apps Admin Toolbox.
2.  Enter an email address where we can contact you, then click **Continue**. _Do not enter the email address of your locked account._ Google generates a support reference number and sends it to the email address you provide.

3. Follow the instructions to help us verify that you own the domain. You'll need to add a [CNAME record](https://support.google.com/a/answer/47283) or [TXT record](https://support.google.com/a/answer/183895) to your DNS record at your domain host. If you’re not sure who your domain host is, go to [Identify your domain host](https://support.google.com/a/answer/48323).
4. After adding the CNAME or TXT record, click **Check Again**.\
   The DNS record can take up to 24 hours to propagate. You can check if the DNS record has propagated using one of the following:
   * <mark style="color:green;">https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#CNAME/</mark>_<mark style="color:green;">reference number.domain</mark>_
   * <mark style="color:green;">https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/</mark>_<mark style="color:green;">domain</mark>_
5. After your DNS record successfully updates, return to the form to complete your request.
6. Select **Request for Password Reset (Recommended)**, and then click **Submit Request.**

After you submit the request, the support team will contact you for the next steps. In some cases, you may need to provide additional verification to make sure access is only granted to the rightful owner of the account.
