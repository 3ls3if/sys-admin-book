# Create organizational units

## Create organizational units

An organizational unit (OU) is a group that an administrator can create in the Google Admin console to apply settings to a specific set of users. By default, all users are placed in the **top-level (parent) organizational unit**. All settings configured in the Admin console apply to this top-level organizational unit and, therefore, to all users and devices in your account. Below the top-level unit, you can add **child organizational units** and apply more specific settings to the child OUs. Child OUs inherit all the settings of their parent OUs. Please note that as the administrator, you canâ€™t move yourself to another organizational unit.
