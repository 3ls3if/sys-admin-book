For this training, you are allowing Google to provision a new domain for you through Squarespace. Click **Buy a new domain**. If you prefer to use an existing domain, choose **Use a domain you already own**.



**Step 6**

Enter your desired domain name. If the domain is available, you will automatically be directed to a new screen with the annual price of the domain specified. If not, either select a name from the provided list of similar domain names or enter another name to be directed to this screen.

**Step 8**

Enter your business address and phone number, then click **Next**.<br>
