# Review your DNS records

## Exercise directions

Each registrar has their own console. The instructions below assume your domain is hosted by Google Domains.\


**Step 1**

If you are not already signed in, sign in to your domain as the Administrator at [admin.google.com](http://admin.google.com/).\


**Step 2**&#x20;

From the main menu, select **Account**. Click **Domains**, then **Manage domains**.\


**Step 3**&#x20;

You’ll be redirected to a page that contains a table listing your domains. Locate the row containing your primary domain (typically the first row).\


Under the **Actions** column, click the **View Details** link in that row.



**Step 4**&#x20;

A panel will pop up containing a dropdown menu for advanced DNS settings. Expand the **Advanced DNS** settings option to see the login information for the DNS console, and click the **SIGN IN TO DNS CONSOLE** link within that section. After signing into the console, you will see a number of records already populated for you.\


These include:

* Mail Exchanger (MX) records. (These ensure mail is routed to Google's servers.)
* A Sender Policy Framework (SPF) TXT record (This allows receiving mail servers to verify that the sending servers are authorized to send mail on your domain’s behalf.)
