# Teams Chat DIfferent Domain: Enable External Access

## Teams Chat Different Domain

With the _external access_ feature in Teams, you can allow users in your organization to chat and meet with people outside the organization who are using Microsoft as an identity provider. You can configure external access with:



1. _<mark style="color:green;">Go to the Teams admin center.</mark>_
2. _<mark style="color:green;">Navigate to Users > External access.</mark>_
3. _<mark style="color:green;">Under Choose which domains your users have access to, select Allow only specific external domains.</mark>_
4. _<mark style="color:green;">Add the domain you want to allow and click Done</mark>_



People from outside your organization won't have access to your teams, sites, or other Microsoft 365 resources. If you want them to have access to your teams and channels, see [Collaborate with guests in a team](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-as-team) and [Collaborate with external participants in a shared channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-teams-direct-connect).
