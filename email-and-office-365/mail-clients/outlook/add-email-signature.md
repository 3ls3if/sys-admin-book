#### Navigate to the section labeled 'Email signature'

Under 'Email signature', you will see a text box where you can type your signature. You can format your text using the options above the box – you can change the font, size, color, and more. You can also add links, pictures, and even your business card.

#### Set the signature as the default and more options to consider

Once you're satisfied with your signature, select the checkbox that applies to you (See screen shot below). You can choose to automatically include your signature on new messages, on forwarded or replied-to messages, both, or neither.
